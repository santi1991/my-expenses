> A React Native project for Web and Android.

## What is in the project
- It was made with **React Native** to create an awesome multi-platform app for web and android. 
- The state management of the project was done using React Context along with its `useContext`, `useReducer` and `useState` hooks. I do not use a library such as Redux. 
- To perform overall optimizations, using React High Order Components such as `React.memo`, altogether with `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks when needed. Special cases should implement `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`.
- This project was detached from **Google Cloud Platform**, since it is actually a portion of a bigger application I was working on. Data is being saved locally an not anymore on an **postgreSQL** database.

## How I worked on this project
These are some of the libraries I usually implement:

### for `React Native` projects
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - brings functionality to the UI. navigation components.
- [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) - collection of customizable and production-ready components for React Native.
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) - framework and a platform for universal React applications.

## What's next...
- Keep a **postgreSQL** instance up for the project.
- I will attached the project again to a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) instance and its services once the project starts to grow over time by adding some more functionality like reports....
